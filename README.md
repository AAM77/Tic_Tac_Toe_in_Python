# Tic_Tac_Toe_in_Python

A basic Tic Tac Toe game written in Python.

It doesn't have AI, so it requires input from both players.
The code could also use some cleaning and refactoring.
I will create a new repo to introduce AI and clean up the code it after I learn more Python.


It isn't in a deployable form, so if you want to test it out, you can fork or clone the repo and test it out in your favorite editor or IDE. I used used Atom as my primary editor, but used Jupyter notebook via Anaconda Navigator for testing the Python code. It was simply easier and more visually pleasing to me.
