# Tic_Tac_Toe_in_Python

A basic Tic Tac Toe game written in Python.

It doesn't have AI, so it requires input from both players.
The code does need some cleaning, but I will come back to it after I learn more Python.

It isn't in a deployable form, so if you want to test it out, you can fork or clone the repo and test it out in your favorite editor or IDE.
